# Customer Churn Prediction (KNIME Workflow)

## Overview
This project predicts customer churn using the Telco Customer Churn dataset and a KNIME-based data science workflow. It was built as part of a graduate Business Analytics course at The University of Texas at Dallas.

## Objectives
- Build an end-to-end churn prediction workflow using KNIME
- Perform data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training
- Evaluate Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models
- Generate insights and actionable business recommendations

## Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle - Telco Customer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)
- **Size**: ~7,043 rows
- **Features**: Demographics, services, billing, contract info
- **Target**: `Churn` (Yes/No)

*Dataset not included due to licensing. Please download it manually from Kaggle.*

## Tools Used
- KNIME Analytics Platform
- PowerPoint (for reporting)
- Python (for exploratory comparison)

## Workflow Summary
1. **Data Ingestion** – File Reader, Data Explorer
2. **Preprocessing** – One-hot encoding, null handling, Min-Max normalization
3. **Feature Engineering** – `tenure_to_total_charges_ratio`
4. **EDA** – Bar Charts, Box Plots, Correlation Matrix
5. **Modeling** – Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
6. **Evaluation** – Accuracy, F1 Score, ROC Curve
7. **Insights** – Feature importance and churn trends

## Model Results
| Model              | F1 Score | Accuracy |
|-------------------|----------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | 0.61     | ~74%     |
| Random Forest       | 0.60    | ~72%     |
| XGBoost             | 0.59    | ~73%     |

**Logistic Regression** had the best F1 Score, balancing recall and precision.

## Key Insights
- Churn is highest among **month-to-month** contract users
- **Fiber optic** customers churn more than DSL users
- **Higher monthly charges** lead to more churn
- Users without **Tech Support** or **Online Security** are at greater risk
